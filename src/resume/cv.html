      Maintain several websites and software libraries, including a learning
      platform under heavy development, a popular Jekyll plugin with over 500
      stars on GitHub and a Rails application tracking approximately 500
      volunteer hours per month.

      As an aircrew member: think and act under pressure, integrate with a team,
      handle complex system failures, know & apply best practices, apply complex
      procedures, self-supervise, and self-instruct.

          This is a popular Jekyll Plugin which automates the tedious process of
          implementing responsive images.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't write it originally, but I did rewrite it! I expanded its
          feature set to fit the modern web, and greatly improved the plugin's
          architecture to simplify future improvements. My rewrite went live in
          November of 2018, and the original maintainer handed the project over
          to me in June of 2019. I've been adding features and improvements on a
          regular basis ever since.

          This Rails application provides training, bulletin, document library,
          and time tracking features to a volunteer component of a county
          sheriff's office. It has been reliably tracking ~500 volunteer hours
          per month since January 2018. I am the only maintainer.

          I wrote this data-wrangling web-application in mid-2019 to solve a
          daily, tedious problem for a group of battery researchers. It runs
          entirely in client-side javascript, taking in thousands of lines of
          raw data in an inconvenient format and returning it in one or more
          organized, useful formats.
